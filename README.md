# COUNTRY

🌍 Country Info App – Project Overview
The Country Info App is a simple and responsive web application that allows users to view detailed information about countries around the world. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app fetches real-time data from an external API and displays key details such as population, capital, region, and flags. This project helped me strengthen my API integration and DOM manipulation skills, while also focusing on clean UI and responsiveness.
